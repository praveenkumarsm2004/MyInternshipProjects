            Collaborating within a team of three, I co-developed a Student Record Management system using HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. Our project offers a streamlined interface for users to input, view, edit, and delete student
            records. My role involved designing and implementing the user interface. This collaborative experience
            enhanced my technical skills and emphasized the importance of teamwork and effective communication in
            software development. This project showcases my ability to work collaboratively, ensuring both functionality
            and user-friendly design in a team environment.<br>

            I developed a Modern Periodic Table program using the C programming language with the objective of creating
            an
            interactive and user-friendly resource for learning about the elements. This project enables users,
            including
            students, educators, and researchers, to explore the elements of the periodic table effortlessly. The
            program
            allows users to access detailed information about each element, including their atomic structure, in a
            convenient manner by enhancing the accessibility and engagement of periodic table information.
